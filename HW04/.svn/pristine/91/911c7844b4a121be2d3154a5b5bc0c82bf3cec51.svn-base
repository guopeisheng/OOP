Type the name of a strategy into the text field on the left.  See the list below for the available strategies. 
 Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to both the drop lists.

"Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list.

"Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. 
The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining.
 For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
 
"Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight. 
 
Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list.
 Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
 
 The following different types of strategies are available for use:
 Breathing
 Color
 Curve
 Floating
 Magnetic
 Straight
